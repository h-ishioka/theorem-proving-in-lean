3. Consider the “barber paradox,” that is, the claim that in a certain town there is a (male) barber that shaves all and only the men who do not shave themselves. Prove that this is a contradiction:
-/

variables (men : Type) (barber : men)
variable  (shaves : men → men → Prop)

example (h : ∀ x : men, shaves barber x ↔ ¬ shaves x x) :
  false := sorry
